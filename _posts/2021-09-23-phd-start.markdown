After a two year stint in the industry as a Machine Learning Engineer at a few different startups ([Mansa](https://getmansa.com) and [Research Grid](https://rgrid.tech)), and a try at launching my own startup through [Entrepreneur First](https://www.joinef.com), I have decided to dive back into NLP research.

I have just joined the [Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Natural Language Processing (NLP) programme](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/natural-language-processing/programme/about-the-programme) at the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of Alex Lascarides and Frank Keller.

The UKRI CDT in NLP is jointly run by the School of Informatics and the School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences and is funded by UK Research & Innovation (UKRI).

My research will focus around multi-modalities, interactive learning, and representation learning. I am particularly interested in how to learn ways to generalise better and transfer existing world knowledge to low data settings where interaction is possible.

Stay tuned for upcoming projects :smile:
